class EventCard:
    """A card representing a kind of thing that can happen.

EventCards are kept in EventDecks, which are in turn contained by
Characters. When something happens involving one or more characters,
the relevant EventDecks from the participating Characters will be put
together into an AttemptDeck. One card will be drawn from this, called
the attempt card. It will identify what kind of EventDeck should be
taken from the participants and compiled in the same manner into an
OutcomeDeck. From this, the outcome card will be drawn.

The effects of an event are determined by both the attempt card and
the outcome card. An attempt card might specify that only favorable
outcomes should be put into the OutcomeDeck; the attempt card might
therefore count itself for a success card. But further, success cards
may have their own effects irrespective of what particular successful
outcome occurs. This may be used, for instance, to model that kind of
success that strains a person terribly and causes them injury.

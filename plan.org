    The partial key is a place name. Delete portals originating here that aren't in the list.

    keeps are strictly the NAMES of portals.

    It doesn't make sense to have a plain "save attribution" because attribution objects do not exist.

** [7/7] permitted

    I suppose this would take an AttrCheck as its argument.

    In this case there's no partial key, you just delete those images that aren't loaded.

    I need to put the key for the menuitem on the menuitem python
    object itself, which means i'll have to change it should i ever
    reorder the menus... or else I could just disallow updating
    menuitems... or store the new index as well? Bah...

    Yeah you know what I'll just not have any way to move a menu item
    around after creation, it's not that hard to make a new one.
*** DONE mkmenuitem
*** DONE updmenuitem
*** DONE writemenuitem
*** DONE loadmenuitem
*** DONE loadmenuitemsin
    Load all menu items that are in a given menu. This may be called as a part of loadmenu.
*** DONE getmenuitem
*** DONE getmenuitemsin
*** DONE delmenuitem
*** DONE delmenuitemsin
** TODO change loaders so they can handle the case where you try to load something that doesn't exist
** TODO schema changes
*** both Spots and Pawns are contained in Canvases
*** Spots are also contained in SpotGraphs
*** How do I store those all in the database?
*** Do I even need SpotGraphs? What are they for?
